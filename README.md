# Safia-timer

## FAC21 Pre-course - Week 4 - Mini Project : Pomodoro Timer
---
## Objective

Build a “[Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer”.

---

## Features
- [ ] A “work” timer that counts down to zero (usually 25 minutes)
- [ ] A second “break” timer that counts down to zero (usually 5 minutes)
- [ ] Buttons to start a session, pause the timer, or cancel the session and restart

## Stretch goals
- [ ] Customisable lengths of time for work/break
- [ ] Play an alarm sound to make it obvious the time is up

---

## Process
- I was aware of what a pomodoro timer was, but i did further research on the subject and got inspiration on my timers functionality from the [Apple Apps store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973130201) 

- I decided on the what features I wanted my timer to have
  - [ ] Set pomodoro interval (0-60minutes)- default set to 25minutes.
  - [ ] Set short break (0-60minutes)- default set to 5 minutes.
  - [ ] Set long break (0-60minutes)- default set to 30 minutes.
  - [ ] A START button, which when pressed changes to STOP.
  - [ ] A INTERVAL box which shows 0/4 at  the start and increases with each interval. At 4/4 , long break is activated after which the interval re-sets to 0/4.
  - [ ] Sounds 
    - [ ] ticking sound for pomodoro interval
    - [ ] ringing bell sound when break starts
    - [ ] ticking sound for short break
    - [ ] ringing bell sound when short break over
    - [ ] ticking sound for long break starts
    - [ ] ringing bell sound when long break over
  - [ ]Vibrations when end of interval/break, along with ringing sound.
  - [ ] Background color changes with pomodoro interval/break
  - [ ] 
-  I created a new repo in github, with a README.md file. I used SSH to git clone the repo in my local terminal
-  I created a index.html and decided to add `style` and `script` tags instead of creating separate files. If the script code gets tolong I may create a separate `script.js` file.

## Things I Learnt

***Issue***
When i was cloning my github repo to my local terminal, i ran the SSH link but kept getting this error.
        zsh: no such file or directory: https://github.com/fac21/safia-timer.git

***Solution***
I forgot to add `git clone` before adding the SSH link. :see_no_evil: :joy:
